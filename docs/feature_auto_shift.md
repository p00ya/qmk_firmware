# Auto Shift: Why Do We Need a Shift Key?

Tap a key and you get its character. Tap a key, but hold it *slightly* longer
and you get its shifted state. Voilà! No shift key needed!

## Why Auto Shift?

Many people suffer from various forms of RSI. A common cause is stretching your
fingers repetitively long distances. For us on the keyboard, the pinky does that
all too often when reaching for the shift key. Auto Shift looks to alleviate that
problem.

## How Does It Work?

When you tap a key, it stays depressed for a short period of time before it is
then released. This depressed time is a different length for everyone. Auto Shift
defines a constant `AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT` which is typically set to twice your
normal pressed state time. When you press a key, a timer starts, and if you
have not released the key after the `AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT` period, then a shifted
version of the key is emitted. If the time is less than the `AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT`
time, or you press another key, then the normal state is emitted.

If `AUTO_SHIFT_REPEAT` is defined, there is keyrepeat support. Holding the key
down will repeat the shifted key, though this can be disabled with
`AUTO_SHIFT_NO_AUTO_REPEAT`. If you want to repeat the normal key, then tap it
once then immediately (within `TAPPING_TERM`) hold it down again (this works
with the shifted value as well if auto-repeat is disabled).

## Are There Limitations to Auto Shift?

Yes, unfortunately.

You will have characters that are shifted when you did not intend on shifting, and
other characters you wanted shifted, but were not. This simply comes down to
practice. As we get in a hurry, we think we have hit the key long enough for a
shifted version, but we did not. On the other hand, we may think we are tapping
the keys, but really we have held it for a little longer than anticipated.

Additionally, with keyrepeat the desired shift state can get mixed up. It will
always 'belong' to the last key pressed. For example, keyrepeating a capital
and then tapping something lowercase (whether or not it's an Auto Shift key)
will result in the capital's *key* still being held, but shift not.

## How Do I Enable Auto Shift?

Add to your `rules.mk` in the keymap folder:

    AUTO_SHIFT_ENABLE = yes

If no `rules.mk` exists, you can create one.

Then compile and install your new firmware with Auto Key enabled! That's it!

## Modifiers

By default, Auto Shift is disabled for any key press that is accompanied by one or more
modifiers. Thus, Ctrl+A that you hold for a really long time is not the same
as Ctrl+Shift+A.

You can re-enable Auto Shift for modifiers by adding a define to your `config.h`

```c
#define AUTO_SHIFT_MODIFIERS
```

In which case, Ctrl+A held past the `AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT` will be sent as Ctrl+Shift+A


## Configuring Auto Shift

If desired, there is some configuration that can be done to change the
behavior of Auto Shift. This is done by setting various variables the
`config.h` file located in your keymap folder. If no `config.h` file exists, you can create one.

A sample is

```c
#pragma once

#define AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT 150
#define NO_AUTO_SHIFT_SPECIAL
```

### AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT (Value in ms)

This controls how long you have to hold a key before you get the shifted state.
Obviously, this is different for everyone. For the common person, a setting of
135 to 150 works great. However, one should start with a value of at least 175, which
is the default value. Then work down from there. The idea is to have the shortest
time required to get the shifted state without having false positives.

Play with this value until things are perfect. Many find that all will work well
at a given value, but one or two keys will still emit the shifted state on
occasion. This is simply due to habit and holding some keys a little longer
than others. Once you find this value, work on tapping your problem keys a little
quicker than normal and you will be set.

?> Auto Shift has three special keys that can help you get this value right very quick. See "Auto Shift Setup" for more details!

### NO_AUTO_SHIFT_SPECIAL (simple define)

Do not Auto Shift special keys, which include -\_, =+, [{, ]}, ;:, '", ,<, .>,
and /?

### NO_AUTO_SHIFT_NUMERIC (simple define)

Do not Auto Shift numeric keys, zero through nine.

### NO_AUTO_SHIFT_ALPHA (simple define)

Do not Auto Shift alpha characters, which include A through Z.

### AUTO_SHIFT_REPEAT (simple define)

Enables keyrepeat.

### AUTO_SHIFT_NO_AUTO_REPEAT (simple define)

Disables automatically keyrepeating when `AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT` is exceeded.

### Custom Keys and Custom Shifted Values

Especially on small keyboards, the default shifted value for many keys is not
optimal. To provide more customizability, there are three user-definable
functions. The first, `autoshift_is_custom`, is called on every key event and
returns whether it should be a part of Auto Shift. The other two are
`autoshift_press/release_user`, and press or release the passed key. If one
does not require custom shift values, only `autoshift_is_custom` is required.
Below is an example adding period to Auto Shift and making its shifted value
exclamation point. Make sure to use weak mods - setting real would make any
keys following it use their shifted values as if you were holding the key.
Clearing of modifiers is handled by Auto Shift, and the os-sent shift value
if keyrepeating multiple keys is always that of the last key pressed (whether
or not it's an Auto Shift key).

You can also have non-shifted keys for the shifted values (or even no shifted
value), just don't set a shift modifier!

```c
bool autoshift_is_custom(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record, uint16_t elapsed) {
    switch(keycode) {
        case KC_DOT:
            break;
        default:
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}
void autoshift_press_user(uint16_t keycode, bool shifted) {
    switch(keycode) {
        case KC_DOT:
            if (!shifted) {
                register_code(KC_DOT);
            } else {
                add_weak_mods(MOD_BIT(KC_LSFT));
                register_code(KC_1);
            }
        default:
            if (shifted) { add_weak_mods(MOD_BIT(KC_LSFT)); }
            register_code(keycode);
    }
}
void autoshift_release_user(uint16_t keycode, bool shifted) {
    switch(keycode) {
        case KC_DOT:
            unregister_code((!shifted) ? KC_DOT : KC_1);
        default:
            unregister_code(keycode);
    }
}
```

Because of how much information you can get from these functions, even more is
possible. Below is a mod-tap-like key that also is a part of Auto Shift (note
the setting of weak mods and user mods, to not confuse Auto Shift). Note this
won't work with keyrepeat, and presses the modifier anyway while held so won't
work with super if you're on Windows (the start menu would open on release).

```c
// Stores whether to hit the key at all, and whether it should be shifted.
bool as_colon[2];
bool autoshift_is_custom(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record, uint16_t elapsed) {
    switch(keycode) {
        case KC_SCLN:
            if (record->event.pressed) {
                //add_mods(MOD_BIT(KC_LSFT)); // Can go here for other modifiers if you want.
                as_colon[0] = true;
            } else {
                // Evaluate on the physical key up.
                del_mods(MOD_BIT(KC_LSFT));
                // Also cancels if you held it for very long, so one can use it with the mouse.
                if (as_colon[0] && elapsed < 3*AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT) {
                    if (as_colon[1]) { add_weak_mods(MOD_BIT(KC_LSFT)); }
                    tap_code(KC_SCLN);
                    del_weak_mods(MOD_BIT(KC_LSFT));
                }
            }
            break;
        default:
            // If there are any key events between the press and release, don't send the key.
            as_colon[0] = false;
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}
void autoshift_press_user(uint16_t keycode, bool shifted) {
    switch(keycode) {
        case KC_SCLN:
            // Has to be here for shift mods, as otherwise it is set halfway through an action and
            // Auto Shift thinks you're holding the mod and restores it on release (causing it to
            // be stuck until you hit this or another shift key again).
            add_mods(MOD_BIT(KC_LSFT));
            // We don't want to send the key until it's released, but need to know the shift state.
            as_colon[1] = shifted;
            return;
        default:
            if (shifted) { add_weak_mods(MOD_BIT(KC_LSFT)); }
            register_code(keycode);
    }
}
void autoshift_release_user(uint16_t keycode, bool shifted) {
    switch(keycode) {
        case KC_SCLN:
            // We never pressed the key.
            return;
        default:
            unregister_code(keycode);
    }
}
```

## Using Auto Shift Setup

This will enable you to define three keys temporarily to increase, decrease and report your `AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT`.

### Setup

Map three keys temporarily in your keymap:

| Key Name | Description                                         |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| KC_ASDN  | Lower the Auto Shift timeout variable (down)        |
| KC_ASUP  | Raise the Auto Shift timeout variable (up)          |
| KC_ASRP  | Report your current Auto Shift timeout value        |
| KC_ASON  | Turns on the Auto Shift Function                    |
| KC_ASOFF | Turns off the Auto Shift Function                   |
| KC_ASTG  | Toggles the state of the Auto Shift feature         |

Compile and upload your new firmware.

### Use

It is important to note that during these tests, you should be typing
completely normal and with no intention of shifted keys.

1. Type multiple sentences of alphabetical letters.
2. Observe any upper case letters.
3. If there are none, press the key you have mapped to `KC_ASDN` to decrease
   time Auto Shift timeout value and go back to step 1.
4. If there are some upper case letters, decide if you need to work on tapping
   those keys with less down time, or if you need to increase the timeout.
5. If you decide to increase the timeout, press the key you have mapped to
   `KC_ASUP` and go back to step 1.
6. Once you are happy with your results, press the key you have mapped to
   `KC_ASRP`. The keyboard will type by itself the value of your
   `AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT`.
7. Update `AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT` in your `config.h` with the value reported.
8. Add `AUTO_SHIFT_NO_SETUP` to your `config.h`.
9. Remove the key bindings `KC_ASDN`, `KC_ASUP` and `KC_ASRP`.
10. Compile and upload your new firmware.

#### An Example Run

    hello world. my name is john doe. i am a computer programmer playing with
    keyboards right now.

    [PRESS KC_ASDN quite a few times]

    heLLo woRLd. mY nAMe is JOHn dOE. i AM A compUTeR proGRaMMER PlAYiNG witH
    KEYboArDS RiGHT NOw.

    [PRESS KC_ASUP a few times]

    hello world. my name is john Doe. i am a computer programmer playing with
    keyboarDs right now.

    [PRESS KC_ASRP]

    115

The keyboard typed `115` which represents your current `AUTO_SHIFT_TIMEOUT`
value. You are now set! Practice on the *D* key a little bit that showed up
in the testing and you'll be golden.
